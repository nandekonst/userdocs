# Get started 

# Create a project in the Jexia Console

# Create datasets

# Add fields

# Make relations

# Interact with your data

You can wire up the connection between your application and your datasets and start consuming data using the Javascript SDK.

The SDK currently exposes the following features:

* on-demand access to data stored in datasets \(creating, reading, updating, deleting records\)
* real-time notifications for subscribed events
* Authentication and authorization is handled automatically by the SDK, the user only needs to provide credentials once at SDK initialization.
