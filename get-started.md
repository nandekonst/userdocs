# Getting started
This guide helps you to set up your Jexia project and to start interact with your data in just a few steps.

## Create a project in the Jexia Dashboard
After you created your account, login to the Jexia Dashboard to create your project. Within a project you can create datasets, add fields to them, set up field validation and make relations between your datasets.

After login you can create a project by clicking the My Projects menu item.

## Create datasets
In order to interact and perform CRUD operations on your data, you need to store the data in a dataset. In order to do so, you need to create the dataset first. Click on your project. Now click the button "create new dataset":
