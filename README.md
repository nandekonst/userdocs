# Welcome to Jexia

Jexia is a platform to speed up the development of your data driven applications. With Jexia you can generate REST API's for your datasets and perform CRUD operations on them in a smart way. Create a project through the Jexia Dashboard, create datasets, add fields to your datasets, make relations between them and start operating on the datasets in your application using our SDK' s.
